\section{Possible future improvements to the simulator}

\subsection{Full Stokes}

Later versions of {\sc MeqSilhouette} will enable the full Stokes cubes as input. This should not entail much work as our chosen data formats (MS, {\sc fits}) and the simulator in {\sc MeqTrees} already support full stokes logic. Signal propagation through the ISM and troposphere as well as antenna based complex gains errors are polarisation independent. The work would be primarly involve altering the existing scripts to dealing with the extra dimension in the {\sc fits} files i.e. book keeping. 
polarisation leakage in the RIME.

\subsection{Opacity and atmospheric brightness temperature fluctuations}

Run multiple realisations of atm to link the phase fluctuations to opacity and brightness temperature fluctuations possibly by fluctuating the input climate parameters., but this might be unfeasible.
