The presence of these bodies are suprising given that host star is still very young. The detail in this image was made possible by the milliarcsec resolution acheivable with ALMA. }}{2}{figure.1.1}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Illustration depicting the basics of scattering in the weak (left) and strong (right) regimes. In the weak regime, the signal is coherently propagated over an area, $A_{\rm weak} \approx \pi r_{\rm F}^2$ whereas in the strong regime, coherent propagation is split over many areas of size $A_{strong} \approx \pi r_{\rm 0}^2$. }}{11}{figure.2.1}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces The $\lambda ^2$ dependence of scattering kernel size is shown by the solid line. This has been derived from measurements made at $\lambda > 17$\nobreakspace {}cm \cite {Bower_2006}. The dotted line shows the derived intrinsic source size which scales as $\lambda ^1.44$. This was derived from measurements in the wavelength range, 2\nobreakspace {}cm\nobreakspace {}$< \lambda < 1.3$\nobreakspace {}mm. The red circles show major-axis observed sizes of Sgr\nobreakspace {}A$^\star $ and the green points show the derived intrinsic major-axis size. This plot was reproduced from \citet {Doeleman_2008}. }}{13}{figure.2.2}

The data has been fit to a sum of $\rm H_20$ lines, an $\rm H_20$ pseudo-continuum and dry absorption lines. The model has been generated using the \textsc {atm} code, with the bottom panel showing the residuals. Here 'dry' refers to all atmospheric constituents except $\rm H_20$.
